Manual Patient Orientation {#org_custusx_registration_method_manual_patient_orientation}
===========================================================

Set patient orientation using the navigation tool.

**Prerequisite:** Image registration.

Only orientation of the reference space is changed - data is not moved.
Align the Polaris tool so that the tools tip points towards the patients feet and the
markers face the same way as the patients nose. Click the button. Verify that the
figure in the upper left corner of the 3D view is correcly aligned.

> Tip: If the patient is orientated with the nose down towards the table, try using *back face*.
