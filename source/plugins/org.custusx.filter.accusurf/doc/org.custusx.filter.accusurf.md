Accusurf Filter {#org_custusx_filter_accusurf}
===================

\addindex accusurf_filter

Accusurf is a visualization methodology of computer tomography (CT) images for navigated flexible endoscopy techniques, like bronchoscopy.
The method utilizes airway centerline data and displays 3D road map from trachea to target.

Input is a "route-to-target", generated by the \ref org_custusx_filter_routetotarget filter, and the corresponding CT volume.
A new CT volume will be generated where the surface follows the route-to-target centerline.

*Algorithm developed by Pall J. Reynisson and implemented by Erlend F. Hofstad.*
