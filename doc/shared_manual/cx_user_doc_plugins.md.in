Plugin troubleshooting
========================
If, for some reason, some plugins fail, the settings.ini file for the user profile
(e.g. ~/CustusX_settings/profiles/Laboratory/settings/settings.ini)
will mark these plugins as uninstalled.

This can be fixed by either deleting the CustusX_settings folder, or edit or delete the settings.ini file.
Another option is to open the \ref browsing_widgets_plugin_framework in CustusX. Here it is possible to start/install/uninstall plugins.
