Video Source {#cx_video_setup}
===================
In order to use a video source, the frame grabber drivers also must be correctly installed. Follow instructions for your
provider and platform. 

The frame grabbers from <http://www.epiphan.com/> have been used successfully with CustusX.

A quick check is to view the video using a standard webcam-application of some kind, f.ex. Photo Booth 
on Mac or Cheese on Linux. If this works, the video source should be ready to use in CustusX.
